# Plant Image Classification Server

This project demonstrates a simple FastAPI server for image classification using pre-trained transformer models from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The server exposes endpoints for different image classification models, allowing users to classify images based on specific categories.

## Models

The server loads several image classification models, each designed for a specific task. The following models are included:

1. **Leaf Disease Classifier**
2. **Fruit Leaf Mushrooms Identifier**
3. **Health Classifier**
4. **Mushroom Classifier**
5. **Leaf Classifier**
6. **Fruit Classifier**
7. **Deficiency Classifier**
8. **Insect Infection Classifier**
9. **Fruit Disease Classifier**
